## Information ##

This document defines the Constants Library of PokemonSMS. 

# Constants Library [bind.const] #

The constants library is a library containing a set of immutable tables that define constant values that can be used in specific circumstances. The values and the actual defined type of the values are unspecified, given a few requirements (listed below). 

As with all other public libraries, Recursive Immutability applies to the Constants Library. Attempting to assign any string or positive integer index of the table obtained from require"Constants" or any member of that result is an error. Attempting to assign any other index for that table results in undefined behavior. 

Additionally, as with all other public libraries, all string and positive integer indecies defined within Constants (or any subconstants) shall be nil if and only if that index is not defined in this file. It is unspecified if any other types of keys have definitions. 

## Symbolic Types [bind.const.symbolic] ##

The Field values defined in `Constants` do not have a real type enforced by this specification. Instead they have a Symbolic Type. The following guarantees are required to be made for these symbolic types: 
* The values are defined and are not false. Formally, they must be considered `true` by any boolean context
* Any valid value of that type compares equal with any other valid value of the same type, if and only if they are the same constant as defined here. 
* Each constant defined to be of the type is a valid value of that type. It is implementation-defined if additional constants are defined to be of the type. Any other values of the symbolic type are invalid. 
* Any valid value of that type compares inequal with any other valid value of the same type, unless the values would compare equal. 

The following operations are not defined for values of a Symbolic type. Formally, attempting any of these operations results in undefined behavior:
* Equality/Inequality Comparison between invalid values of the same type, or between an invalid value and a valid value, even if such a comparison would otherwise be well defined. 
* Equality/Inequality Comparison between values of any symbolic type and any value of a different type, even if such a comparison would otherwise be well defined. 
* Relational Comparison between a value of a symbolic type and any value, even if such a comparison would otherwise be well defined. 
* Conversion to/Use as any other type in lua, except boolean. 
* Indexing/Assigning an index of the value, including via pairs/ipairs
* Any arithmetic, bitwise (if supported), or concatination operator

Additionally, the result of using type() on a value of a symbolic type is unspecified.
