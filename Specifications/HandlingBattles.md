This document defines the logical sequence of events that occur during battle (this provides sequencing on event handlers). 

# Battle Event Handling #

## Handling Combat Moves ##
A combat move is defined as a move registered with category=Constants.Categories.PHYSICAL or Constants.Categories.SPECIAL. 

Combat Moves deal damage, they have secondary effects and are affected by type effectiveness. 

If a calculation only takes place with integer values, 

During Battle b, when Pokemon a, controlled by Side s, uses a Combat Move m on the list of targets ts..., Resolve the following for each target t in ts... in slot order, except that if any step causes the move to fail, then no additional steps are applied for that target: 
1. Create a State k for the move. The state has the type Battle#CombatState as defined in the ScriptBindings specification. The Source is a, the Source Side is s, the Move is m, the base category is m:getCategory(), the base type is m:getType(), the target is t, the target side is t:getSide(), and the battle is b. 
2. Check move preconditions. If m:hasTrait("ohko") is true, then t:getLevel() <= b:getLevel() must also be true, or the move fails with `{"translate":"traits.ohko.cantaffect"},m:getName(),t:getName()`. 
3. Check move accuracy. If m:hasTrait("noaccuracy") is true, then skip this step. Otherwise resolve the following sequence in order.
    1. Set the Base Accuracy Modifier to `a:getInBattleStat(Constants.Stats.Accuracy)` and the base Evasion Modifier to `t:getInBattleStat(Constants.Stats.Evasion)`
    2. If m.getAccuracy is a function value or a callable value, then the base accuracy value is set to the result of m:getAccuracy(a,t)
    3. Otherwise the base accuracy value is set to m.accuracy field. This shall be a number between 0 and 1.
    4. An event of type Events.Battle.Combat.CheckAccuracy is published as below. The source of the event is a, and the parameters are a,t,b,m,k.
    5. The modified accuracy value is calculated as q*c/v, where q is the base accuracy value, c is the accuracy modifier, and v is the evasion modifier. If this is 1 or greater, then the move hits. Otherwise, if a random number in (0,1] is greater than this value, the move fails with `{"translate":"generic.combat.miss"},m:getName()`. Otherwise the move hits.
