## Information ##
This is the main document of the PokemonSMS Specification, provided by the PokemonSMS Public Specification Project. This defines the minimum requirements of clients and servers, as well as linking to various subdocuments which contain the specifications of each component. 
It is not required that this be distributed with a PokemonSMS Implementation. 
However, it is recommended that Implementations document the supported components, and link to the relevant documents in this specification. 

# Complete Specification #

This, and all subdocuments define the many components of a PokemonSMS Implementation, and requirements for and restrictions as to how they are provided. 
PokemonSMS Implementations built using this specification should work identically to other implementions, for the provided components. 

The goal of this specification is to define a uniform definition for PokemonSMS Implementations, so that the Core may work independently from the Implementation.  
It also makes it so that there is a uniform base for making similar Pokemon Fan Games, which theoretically could run on any Implementation.
